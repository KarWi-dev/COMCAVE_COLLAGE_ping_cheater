# ping_cheater
A cheat app to avoid annoying presence pings. (e.g. for students)  

It was made to automate the process of logging in and putting in a ping **only** via mouse as the Ping is requestng it when it pops up over everything else.

# THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT ONLY. IT IS NOT MENT FOR REAL USE.

You can change or delete the loginpart as u need it just as u can change the Pictures that are used as a reference to find them on the screen.  
You will have to provide your own pictures of the input screen and the singled out buttons.



### You will need to install Tesseract and put the main.py and the picture folder into a new folder called ping_cheater in the root directory of your drive.
